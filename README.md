# drum-kit-project
This Drum Kit Project utilizes HTML5 for the structure, CSS3 for styling and ensuring responsiveness, and JavaScript for interactive features. JavaScript manages event handling for button clicks and keypresses, plays drum sounds using the Audio object, and controls button animations to provide visual feedback. Works with various devices as well.
